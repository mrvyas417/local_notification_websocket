# Push Notifications in Flutter Without Using Third-Party Services

This guide explains how to implement push notifications in a Flutter application using WebSockets and local notifications, without relying on third-party services like Firebase. We will set up:

- **flutter_local_notifications**: For displaying local notifications.
- **web_socket_channel**: For real-time WebSocket communication.
- **Node.js WebSocket server**: To push notifications from the server.
- **MethodChannel**: For platform-specific integrations.

## Prerequisites

1. **Flutter SDK**: Installed on your machine.
2. **Node.js and npm**: Installed for setting up the backend WebSocket server.
3. **Basic understanding of WebSocket protocol**: For real-time communication.

---

## Step 1: Add Required Dependencies

In your Flutter project, add the following dependencies to `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_local_notifications: ^12.0.0
  web_socket_channel: ^2.2.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the packages.

---

## Step 2: Create Node.js WebSocket Server

To enable WebSocket-based communication between the server and your Flutter app, create a simple Node.js WebSocket server.

1. **Set up the Node.js project**:

   - Create a directory for your project and run `npm init` to initialize the Node.js project.
   - Install the WebSocket package by running:
     ```bash
     npm install ws
     ```

2. **Create a WebSocket server**:
   - In your project folder, create a `server.js` file to set up the WebSocket server.
   - The WebSocket server should listen for client connections and, for testing purposes, echo back the messages it receives.

---

## Step 3: Testing WebSocket with Echo Server

1. **Run the WebSocket server**:

   - Start the Node.js WebSocket server by running:
     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```

2. **Connect the Flutter app to the WebSocket server**:

   - In your Flutter app, use the `web_socket_channel` package to connect to the WebSocket server.

3. **Test message exchange**:
   - Send random test messages from Flutter to the server and verify that the echo server responds with the same message.

---

## Step 4: Integrate WebSocket Notifications in Node.js

Once the WebSocket connection is established and tested with the echo server, you can modify the server to push notification-related data.

1. **Modify the Node.js WebSocket server**:
   - Instead of echoing back the received data, send notification payloads from the server to the Flutter app.
   - These payloads should include information such as the notification title, body, and any additional data.

---

## Step 5: Use WebSocket in Flutter for Notification Handling

In the Flutter app:

1. **Connect to the WebSocket server**:

   - Use `web_socket_channel` to establish a connection with the WebSocket server.

2. **Listen for notification messages**:

   - When a message containing notification data is received from the server, extract the details (such as title and body).

3. **Display local notifications**:
   - Trigger a local notification using `flutter_local_notifications` to show the notification to the user.

---

## Step 6: Extend with MethodChannel

If your app needs to handle more advanced notifications or platform-specific features, you can use `MethodChannel` to communicate with native Android or iOS code.

- **Invoke native services**: Play custom notification sounds, or handle other native actions (such as scheduling notifications or handling notification actions).
- **Background processing**: Manage how notifications are handled when the app is in the background or terminated.

---

## Step 7: Testing the Full Setup

Test your notification system end-to-end:

1. **Run the Node.js WebSocket server**.
2. **Launch the Flutter app** and establish the WebSocket connection.
3. **Simulate a notification** by sending test messages from the Node.js server and observe if the notifications are displayed in the Flutter app.
4. **Test on both Android and iOS** to ensure the notifications behave as expected.

## Conclusion

This documentation explains how to implement push notifications in a Flutter app without using third-party services. Using a WebSocket server with Node.js and `flutter_local_notifications`, your app can receive and display notifications in real-time. This solution is flexible, allowing for customization and further extension using native platform-specific features through `MethodChannel`.
